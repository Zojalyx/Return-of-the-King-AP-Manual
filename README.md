This is the first version of Return of the King Manual for Archipelago NOW PLAYABLE!!! 


*****NOTE*****
This currently does NOT have support for Co-op. There will probably be a separate AP world for co-op and that will be a project for a later date 

In order to get the full experience of the Randomizer you will need to complete Crack of Doom and/or Palantirs and then get every character to level 20 WITHOUT purchasing any upgrades whatsoever. Once you complete crack of doom then cheat codes are available and you can use them to level up the characters quickly!!!
